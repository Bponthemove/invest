- create react app with typescript template
- git init
- create repo and link it to dir
- install axios, sass and types
- find free api with historical data ---> tradermade
- setup section with list of available pairs or instruments
    - section is initially derived from array with forex pairs, later I'll add a dropdown to choose between forex, crypto or indices, which
      will list items accordingly. Have dataArrays for these three groups.
- set up axios hook to call api for the relevant data
- set up context provider to avoid prop drilling
- set up details section, which consists of
    - info tab with current price, %deviation of close yesterday, high and low of the day, high and low of the past 20 days.
